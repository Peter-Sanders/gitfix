gitfix \- cherry pick files between a source and target git branch

gitfix -t [TARGET_BRANCH] -s [SOURCE_BRANCH] -d [DEFAULT_BRANCH]
.SH DESCRIPTION
gitfix is a program that is designed to take a source feature branch, based on a default branch (e.g. "main"), pointed towards a conflicted target branch, cherry pick files from the source, create a new branch based on the target, and apply them to the new branch to mitigate merge issues.

-t [TARGET_BRANCH] -s [SOURCE_BRANCH] -d [DEFAULT_BRANCH] (defaults to "main") -h [HELP] (optional)
.SH SEE ALSO
git diff --name-status
.SH BUGS
V1.0 When entering vi for interactive file choosing, the header part of the temp file isn't written. No functionality is impacted but a helpful prompt at the top would be nice.
V1.0 Can't handle file deletions
V1.1 vi mode removed for now
